You do not need to pass in any values in the interval parameter since the granularity is defaulted to be as the image attached. Here’s an example of how your request URL should look like: https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/bitcoin/market_chart?vs_currency=usd&days=30


In the meantime, please note that 5 minute interval data for anything more than 1 day is only exclusively available to the Enterprise plan. If you’re interested in 5-minute intervals for historical data, kindly contact us at api@coingecko.com.

Cache / Update Frequency:
every 5 minutes for all the API plans
The last completed UTC day (00:00) is available 35 minutes after midnight on the next UTC day (00:35). The cache will always expire at 00:40 UTC
Access to historical data via the Public API (Demo plan) is restricted to the past 365 days only. To access the complete range of historical data, please subscribe to one of our paid plans to obtain a Pro-API key.
